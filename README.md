## Project Learning

I learned a lot during this project's development; firstly, I was really surprised by the world of back-end development with NodeJS. First of all, I need to mention that during this period, I learned about the importance of testing our code and how it can accelerate our application development!

The second thing is Prisma and Docker; I had never used them before, but after building my first application using these technologies, it's kind of impossible not to use an ORM to manage my database and a Docker container to avoid some unnecessary database dependencies.
